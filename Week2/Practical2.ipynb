    "In the first practical for EGM711, you learned how to use ArcGIS Pro to make maps, given shapefiles of different features of interest in Northern Ireland. In this practical, you will repeat the exercise, this time using `cartopy`, `geopandas`, and `matplotlib`, three python packages used for making maps, working with vector data, and making plots, respectively. \n",

    "## Objectives\n",

For now, don't worry too much about what each individual line does - we'll go over these in a bit more depth as we go. Remember also that if you get stuck, you can get help in a few ways:\n",

    "2. using ipython's (the python interpreter used by jupyter-notebooks) help shortcut (i.e., `plt.text?`)\n",
    "3. finding the online documentation for the module (usually achieved via option 4)\n",
    "4. searching google (or your search engine of choice) \n",
    "5. consulting your favorite medicine man/shaman/spiritual guide\n",
    "6. asking the instructor, who will in all likelihood resort to one of the other options (usually 5 or 4)."
