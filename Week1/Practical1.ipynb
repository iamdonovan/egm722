    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in this week's lecture, programming is a powerful tool that allows us to do complicated calculations and analysis, visualize data, and automate workflows to ensure consistency, accuracy, and reproducability in our research. In this practical, you will learn and practice basic commands in python and import modules to complete more complicated tasks. In the weeks to come, you will learn to work with different GIS datasets such as vector (e.g., shapefiles) or raster files using python libraries.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "-  Learn and gain experience with some of the basic elements of python and programming\n",

Remember that a `GeoDataFrame` can hold lots of different data, but it needs a column that specifies the geometry of a feature. Given that we only have point information (a single Lat/Lon coordinate) for each lake, it makes sense to create a `Point` object for each feature using that point. We can do this by first using the python built-in __zip__, then the __apply__ method of the `DataFrame` to create a point object from the list of coordinates."
